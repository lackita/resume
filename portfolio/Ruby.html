<h2>Problem</h2>

<p><a href="https://projecteuler.net/problem=244">Problem 244</a> on <a href="https://projecteuler.net">Project Euler</a> is a modified breadth first search. Reproduction of the problem statement:</p>

<p>You probably know the game Fifteen Puzzle. Here, instead of numbered tiles, we have seven red tiles and eight blue tiles.</p>

<p>A move is denoted by the uppercase initial of the direction (Left, Right, Up, Down) in which the tile is slid, e.g. starting from configuration (S), by the sequence LULUR we reach the configuration (E):</p>

<p>(S) <img src="https://projecteuler.net/project/images/p244_start.gif">, (E) <img src="https://projecteuler.net/project/images/p244_example.gif"></p>

<p>For each path, its checksum is calculated by (pseudocode):</p>

$$checksum = 0$$
$$checksum = (checksum × 243 + m1) mod 100 000 007$$
$$checksum = (checksum × 243 + m2) mod 100 000 007$$
$$...$$
$$checksum = (checksum × 243 + mn) mod 100 000 007$$

<p>where mk is the ASCII value of the kth letter in the move sequence and the ASCII values for the moves are:</p>

<ul>
	<li>L: 76</li>
	<li>R: 82</li>
	<li>U: 85</li>
	<li>D: 68</li>
</ul>

<p>For the sequence LULUR given above, the checksum would be 19761398.</p>

<p>Now, starting from configuration (S), find all shortest ways to reach configuration (T).</p>

<p>(S) <img src="https://projecteuler.net/project/images/p244_start.gif">, (T) <img src="https://projecteuler.net/project/images/p244_target.gif"></p>

<p>What is the sum of all checksums for the paths having the minimal length?</p>

<h2>Solution</h2>

<p>This problem can be represented as a directed graph, in which the nodes are the various board positions and edges represent a move that can be made to reach that node.</p>

<p>To avoid generating too much of the graph, the adjacency list is lazily evaluated. The BFS will regenerate some nodes, but experimentation with memoization did not yield a noticeable improvement in performance.</p>

<pre><code class="ruby">class Node
  attr_reader :position

  def initialize(position)
    @position = position
  end

  def open_slot
    @open_slot ||= begin
      @position.each_index do |row|
        @position[row].each_index do |col|
          if @position[row][col] == " "
            return {row: row, col: col}
          end
        end
      end
    end
  end

  def edges
    edges = []

    if open_slot[:col] > 0
      edges.push(Edge.new(self, "R"))
    end

    if open_slot[:col] < last_col
      edges.push(Edge.new(self, "L"))
    end

    if open_slot[:row] > 0
      edges.push(Edge.new(self, "D"))
    end

    if open_slot[:row] < last_row
      edges.push(Edge.new(self, "U"))
    end

    edges
  end

  def last_row
    @position.length - 1
  end

  def last_col
    @position[0].length - 1
  end

  def ==(other_node)
    @position == other_node.position
  end

  def to_s
    @position.map { |row| row.join("") }.join("\n")
  end
end

class Edge
  attr_reader :direction

  def initialize(origin, direction)
    @origin = origin
    @direction = direction
  end

  def node
    @node ||= Node.new(new_position)
  end

  def new_position
    @new_position ||= begin
      new_position = @origin.position.map { |row| row.clone }
      new_position[old_open_slot[:row]][old_open_slot[:col]] = new_position[new_open_slot[:row]][new_open_slot[:col]]
      new_position[new_open_slot[:row]][new_open_slot[:col]] = " "
      new_position
    end
  end

  def old_open_slot
    @origin.open_slot
  end

  def new_open_slot
    if @direction == "L"
      {row: @origin.open_slot[:row], col: @origin.open_slot[:col] + 1}
    elsif @direction == "R"
      {row: @origin.open_slot[:row], col: @origin.open_slot[:col] - 1}
    elsif @direction == "U"
      {row: @origin.open_slot[:row] + 1, col: @origin.open_slot[:col]}
    elsif @direction == "D"
      {row: @origin.open_slot[:row] - 1, col: @origin.open_slot[:col]}

<p>Standard BFS will give an optimal path, which was implemented first to explore the problem. This experimentation showed that the optimal path was 32 moves long, and could be computed in about 14 seconds.</p>

<p>To enhance BFS to consider all paths of optimal length, a different notion of unprocessed needs to be introduced. Standard BFS only considers a node unprocessed if it has not yet been discovered during the processing of a previous node. In the modified form, the discovered data structure is enhanced to store the distance of an optimal path to that node, and any path matching that distance will also be considered.</p>

<p>This approach is correct, but spends a large amount of its time reconsidering the same paths. In addition to tracking the optimal distance to a node, the paths already considered are ignored.</p>

<pre><code class="ruby">class Path

    checksum = 0

      checksum = (checksum*243 + move.ord) % 100000007
    end
    checksum
  end

  def add_step(edge)
    @node = edge.node
    @moves.push(edge.direction)

    @moves.length

  def clone
    Path.new(@node, @moves.clone)

  def initialize(start, finish)
    @finish = finish
    @unprocessed = [Path.new(start)]
    @shortest_distance_to_position = {start.position => 0}

<p>With these classes in place, the only thing left is to perform the final computation for the problem:</p>

<pre><code class="ruby">finish = Node.new([[" ", "B", "R", "B"],
                   ["B", "R", "B", "R"],
                   ["R", "B", "R", "B"],
                   ["B", "R", "B", "R"]])

start = Node.new([[" ", "R", "B", "B"],
                  ["R", "R", "B", "B"],
                  ["R", "R", "B", "B"],
                  ["R", "R", "B", "B"]])

print BFS.new(start, finish).minimal_paths.map { |path| path.checksum }.inject :+</code></pre>

<p>Without the path optimization, the answer is found in about 5 minutes. With the optimization that is reduced to about 30 seconds. It turns out that there is only one optimal path to the board position in the problem, but that doesn't hold true for every board position.</p>
